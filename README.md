# Multi-tenancy Starter Kit

This is a start template I have created for multi-tenacy personal projects.

It is uses the following technologies:

- Next.js 14 with Pages Router
- tRPC for client-server communication
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM via the Neon Serverless Driver
- Rate Limiting with Upstash Redis
- Lucia Auth v3
- Emails via Resend & React Email

More information about the project can be found on my [personal site](https://www.tombruce.au/projects/multitenancy-starter).
